# Psychic-Game - the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. The following text displays on the page:
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Displays these until the user either wins or loses.)
When the player wins, the Wins counter increases and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and the game starts over again.
